# Dog Breed Identification Using Deep Learning

---

## Problem Statement ~

We often do you get stuck thinking about the name of a dogâ€™s breed. There are many dog breeds and most of them are similar to each other. Can we use a dog breeds dataset and build a Deep
Learning model that will classify different dog breeds from an image. Use Convolutional Neural Networks to build the model.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle. <br>
